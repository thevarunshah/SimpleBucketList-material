# SimpleBucketList

Simple Bucket List is just what the name suggests - it lets you keep a bucket list of things that you want to do. </br>
When you finish them, you can simply check them off and keep them, archive them, or delete them. </br>
It can also be used as a to-do list or a place where you can just jot down your ideas.
